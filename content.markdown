# Content Strategy 

## Goals
My current set up is a single page portfolio that lacks some features and content that I'd like to start using.

There are some things I like:
* Responsive
* Focused content quickly shows visitors who I am
* Interactive easter eggs (hover over icons and graphs)

There's also things I want to add/improve:
* Design aesthetics (Be more sleek/modern, rather than grungy and blegh)
* Functionality
	* Multiple images for portfolio items
	* Multiple portfolio categories to encompass more design work
	* Ability to create non-portfolio content
* Make my portfolio more like an app (load new content in-page)
