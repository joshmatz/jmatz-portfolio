# Portfolio planning stages
* Content planning
	* What content, how to organize?
	* [File containing rough plans](https://github.com/joshmatz/jmatz-portfolio/blob/master/content.markdown)
* Technology
	* What backend technology should I use?
		* PHP is the simplest to go with and I'm familiar with it more.
		* Again, WP I think may be the best option. I could go CakePHP, but then I have to create more backend work and I'd prefer to focus on design challenges.
		* Joshua Kelly has a good writeup of [Backbone.js with WordPress](http://robotfuture.net/2012/03/11/backbonejs-and-wordpress/) that's made me a little more confident going with WP since someone else has thought through some of the problems already.
		* Just found [Slim Framework](http://www.slimframework.com/) which may play nicer with Backbone or something.
			* Looks like it may have a higher learning curve than I'd like. Doesn't have ORM, which would be nice.
	* What frontend technologies should I use?
		* I really want to keep everyone on one page load and load in additional content as needed.
		* I am looking at Backbone.js and Ember.js, but I'm unsure if WP is able to function well with them.
		* ~~Looked up spinejs. It's looking promising.~~ It doesn't seem to be under as active development as Backbone.
	* Do I use a framework to build out anything quicker?
	* After all that, I will test out Backbone + WP and see if I can get it functional the way I want. I will also start with the [Bones WordPress theme](http://themble.com/bones/) to get the basics aside.
