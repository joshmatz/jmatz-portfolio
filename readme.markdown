# About me
I am currently attending Baylor University and will be graduating with a Bachelors of Fine Arts in Graphic Design in December. One of my final classes is a Portfolio class, with a focus on a printed portfolio. However, I have more passion for the digital and will be working on a more awesome website than [my current one](http://www.joshmatz.com). This repository will track my travels through the process of creating it.
